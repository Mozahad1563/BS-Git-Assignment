The main differences between the three reset options are how they handle the staging area and the working directory:

## Soft Reset: ## 
Keeps changes staged, leaves the working directory unchanged.
## Mixed Reset: ##
Unstages changes, leaves the working directory unchanged.
## Hard Reset:##
Discards changes completely, modifies the working directory to match the specified commit.
